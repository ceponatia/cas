Core Architecture Implemented:

  - L1 Working Memory: In-memory buffer for recent conversation turns
  - L2 Episodic Graph: Neo4j-based graph storage with VAD emotional states

  - L3 Semantic Archive: FAISS vector database for summaries and insights
  - Memory Controller Agent: Central orchestrator with intelligent
  ingestion and retrieval

  Key Features Delivered:

  - 4-Panel Interactive UI: Chat, Under the Hood, Memory Inspector, Prompt
  Inspector
  - Token Cost & Fusion Tuner: Real-time sliders for memory layer weights
  - Emotional State Visualizer: Chart.js-based VAD tracking over time
  - Real-time WebSocket Updates: Live memory operation streaming
  - Significance Scoring: Automated event detection and importance ranking

  Technical Stack:

  - Monorepo Structure: PNPM workspace with 5 packages
  - Backend: Fastify + Neo4j + FAISS + Ollama integration
  - Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
  - Infrastructure: Docker Compose with Neo4j and Redis
  - Development: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

  Production-Ready Features:

  - Weighted Memory Fusion: Mathematical scoring formula implemented
  - VAD Emotional Model: Complete valence-arousal-dominance tracking
  - Significance Detection: Multi-factor analysis with NLP patterns
  - WebSocket Architecture: Real-time bidirectional communication
  - Comprehensive APIs: REST endpoints for all memory operations

  The project is ready for development and testing. Users can start the
  infrastructure with pnpm docker:up, build with pnpm build, and launch
  with pnpm dev to explore the full cognitive architecture in action.

  The only remaining optional enhancement is fact versioning and conflict 
  resolution (Phase 3), which can be implemented as needed for advanced use
   cases.
